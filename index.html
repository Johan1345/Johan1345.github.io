                <h2>Why playstation will always be better than trash midbox</h2>
                <p>Playstation has better exclusives like uncharted, god for war,ratchet clank, and crash bandicoot.Lets
                    bee honest Xbox only has forza horizan and microsoft simulator, Even then you can still play those
                    on pc so they're not even exclusive. Playstation also has spider man and all the games have been
                    amazing. In conclusion Its your choice at the end of the day its your choice if you want to use
                    Midbox or playstaion, PC will always be faster but consoles are good and
                    <strong>cheap.</strong> <strong>
                        but for
                        many gamers, 's exclusive games, user-friendly interface, and multimedia capabilities
                        make it a preferred gaming platform.</strong>

                    <h2 style="font-size: xx-large;">The VScode expirence</h2>
                    <p>Visual Studio Code (VSCode) has been a good expirence for me, Its good for people who just want
                        to create websites and show them off to friends or family.I think its good for people who want
                        to start making websites because its not as complicated as other stuff like <strong>Phyton or
                            javascript.</strong>The best thing about it is that it is <strong>free and you dont have to
                            pay for it.</strong>In conclusion its good for both new people like me and for expirenced
                        people.</p>
